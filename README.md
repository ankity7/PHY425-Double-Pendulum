# PHY425-Double-Pendulum
I have used RK4 method to solve the coupled differential equations for double pendulums. The differential equations were obatined using Lagrange's equation of motion in polar coordinates.
There are two jupyter notebooks in the folder  : Python codes

'Simulating N Double Pendulums together' is for creating a gif on N (User input) number of Double pendulums. One can change initial conditions in the code to simulate various cases. Initial condition for my case is mentioned in the code itself.
