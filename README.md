# PHY425-Double-Pendulum
I have used the RK4 method to solve the coupled differential equations for double pendulums. The differential equations were obtained using Lagrange's equation of motion in polar coordinates.
There are two jupyter notebooks in the folder: Python codes.
'Double pendulum' is for plotting and solving various cases two show the chaotic motion of two or three double pendulums. It also includes plots for 'angle vs time', 'y vs x ' etc., for double pendulums. If you want to see the evolution of angular velocity of both masses of a double pendulum, you can use 'omega1 and omega2' from the output of the code to plot them.
'Simulating N Double Pendulums together' creates a gif on N (User input) number of Double pendulums. One can change initial conditions in the code to simulate various cases. The initial condition for my case is mentioned in the code.
